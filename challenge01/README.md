This week's challenge for you:
Create a simple HTML form with JavaScript validation.
Things to validate for:
1. Fields should not be empty
2. Email should be valid
3. Passwords should be a minimum of 8 characters.

Fields your form should have:
1. Name
2. Email
3. Password (password should be hidden when typing)

*Try to show the error messages inline with the form. Also, they should be hidden once the correct input has been submitted.Avoid using alert(). Show a thank you message after the form has been successfully validated*

Try to make the UI as slick as possible and put your code on Github by Sunday afternoon 3:00pmsa
